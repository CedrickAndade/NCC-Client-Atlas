# NCC-Client-Atlas
The NCC Client Atlas: Immigration Insights was developed to understand and visualize the geographic distribution of NCCâ€™s clients within its catchment area. Immigrants and refugees in rural regions encounter unique difficulties related to resource allocation and outreach, making it essential to identify patterns and service gaps.
